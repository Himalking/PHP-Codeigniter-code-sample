PHP-Codeigniter code sample


This is an underdevelopment demo for a Realestate sample portal using PHP-Codeigniter MVC framework.
The demo provides a cool experience of a Full-Ajax form load and instant ajax form validation without using any iframes nor page reloads.

A GLIMPSE:
Once you create a Project you can define Units in it and update its data, images, videos, files, and links.
Same goes for Units.


NOTE:
You may encounter a decreased performance due to using FREE hosting along with the difference between the database hosting server (db4free.net) and the control panel hosting server (000webhost.com).
However in "Realestate_Demo_Full_Source.zip" you will find the full source for the demo along with a readme file describing how to configure and deploy the files on your localhost or publishing server.
